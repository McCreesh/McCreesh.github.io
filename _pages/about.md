I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California San Diego, supervised by Jorge Cortes. I completed my M.A.Sc. and B.A.Sc., in Mathematics and Engineering at Queen's University in Kingston, Canada, in 2019 and 2017, respectively. 

My research interests are in the control of dynamical systems, using both analytic and data-driven methods. I am interested in the application of dynamical systems theory to understanding neural behaviours and the study of large interconnected networks.
