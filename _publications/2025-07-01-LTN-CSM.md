Over the past two decades, an increasing array of control-theoretic
methods have been used to study the brain as a complex dynamical
system and better understand its structure-function relationship.
This article provides an overview on one such family of methods, based
on the linear-threshold rate (LTR) dynamics, which arises when
modeling the spiking activity of neuronal populations and their impact
on each other.  LTR dynamics exhibit a wide range of behaviors based
on network topologies and inputs, including mono- and multi-stability,
limit cycles, and chaos, allowing it to be used to model many complex
brain processes involving fast and slow inhibition, multiple time and
spatial scales, different types of neural behavior, and higher-order
interactions.  Here we investigate how the versatility of LTR dynamics
paired with concepts and tools from systems and control can provide a
computational theory for explaining the dynamical mechanisms enabling
different brain processes. Specifically, we illustrate stability and
stabilization properties of LTR dynamics and how they are related to
goal-driven selective attention, multistability and its relationship
with declarative memory, and bifurcations and oscillations and their
role in modeling seizure dynamics in epilepsy.
