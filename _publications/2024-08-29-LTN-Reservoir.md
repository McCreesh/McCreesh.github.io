  Learning is a key function in the brain to be able to achieve the
  activity patterns required to perform various activities. While
  specific behaviors are determined by activity in localized regions,
  the interconnections throughout the entire brain play a key role in
  enabling its ability to exhibit desired activity. To mimic this
  setup, this paper examines the use of reservoir computing to control
  a linear-threshold network brain model to a desired trajectory.  We
  first formally design open- and closed-loop controllers that achieve
  reference tracking under suitable conditions on the synaptic
  connectivity. Given the impracticality of evaluating closed-form
  control signals, particularly with growing network complexity, we
  provide a framework where a reservoir of a larger size than the
  network is trained to drive the activity to the desired pattern. We
  illustrate the versatility of this setup in two applications:
  selective recruitment and inhibition of neuronal populations for
  goal-driven selective attention, and network intervention for the
  prevention of epileptic seizures.
